     * \brief Texture filtering modes for controlling pixel sampling behavior
     *
     * Filtering determines how OpenGL samples texture pixels when the texture
     * is displayed at a different size than its native resolution. The choice
     * between nearest-pixel and linear filtering dramatically affects the
     * visual appearance of textures.
     *
     * Filtering affects both magnification (when texture appears larger than
     * its pixel resolution) and minification (when texture appears smaller).
     * The choice depends on the desired visual style and performance requirements.
     *
     * Visual characteristics:
     * - NearestPixel: Sharp, pixelated appearance with hard edges
     * - Linear: Smooth, blended appearance with soft edges
     *
     * Performance considerations:
     * - NearestPixel: Faster sampling, lower memory bandwidth
     * - Linear: More expensive sampling, higher memory bandwidth

     * clamping behaviors essential for different rendering scenarios.
     *
     * Each mode serves specific use cases:
     * - Tiling textures (Repeat, MirroredRepeat)
     * - UI elements and single textures (ClampToEdge, ClampToBorder)
     * - Special effects and seamless patterns (MirrorClampToEdge)
