     * \brief Descriptive alias for OpenGL buffer object handles
     *
     * BufferHandle provides a more specific and readable name for the generic
     * OpenGL handle type. While it doesn't add type safety (it's still the same
     * underlying type as other OpenGL handles), it makes the code's intent clearer
     * by indicating that this handle specifically refers to buffer objects.
     *
     * This alias helps with:
     * - Code readability: immediately clear this refers to a buffer
     * - Documentation: function signatures clearly indicate buffer parameters
     * - Consistency: uniform naming convention across the OpenGL wrapper
     *
     * Note: This is purely a naming convenience - the compiler treats BufferHandle
     * identically to the generic Handle type, so mixing them won't cause errors.
     * The real type safety comes from the BufferType enum and API design.

     * \brief Enumeration of OpenGL buffer types for different rendering purposes
     *
     * BufferType categorizes buffers based on their intended use in the graphics
     * pipeline. Each type corresponds to a specific OpenGL buffer target that
     * determines how the GPU will access and use the buffer data.
     *
     * The enum values map directly to OpenGL constants but provide a more
     * type-safe and readable interface. This helps prevent binding buffers
     * to incorrect targets and makes the code's intent clearer.
     *
     * Buffer Types:
     * - Vertices: Stores vertex attribute data (positions, colors, texture coordinates)
     * - Indices: Stores element indices for indexed drawing operations
     * - UniformBlocks: Stores uniform data shared across multiple shader invocations
