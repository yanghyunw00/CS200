    /**
     * \brief High-level texture wrapper for 2D graphics rendering and resource management
     *
     * Texture provides a convenient, RAII-compliant wrapper around OpenGL texture objects
     * that simplifies texture loading, rendering, and resource management. The class handles
     * the complex details of OpenGL texture creation, coordinate system transformations,
     * and automatic memory cleanup while providing an intuitive interface for 2D graphics.
     *
     * Key Features:
     * - Automatic texture loading from image files with proper format conversion
     * - RAII resource management ensuring textures are properly cleaned up
     * - High-level drawing interface with transformation matrix support
     * - Sprite sheet support for animation and texture atlases
     * - Integration with the 2D renderer for efficient batched rendering
     * - Move semantics for efficient texture transfers and storage
     *
     * Resource Management:
     * The texture automatically handles OpenGL texture creation and deletion through
     * RAII principles. Move-only semantics prevent accidental texture duplication
     * while allowing efficient transfer of texture ownership between objects.
     *
     * Coordinate Systems:
     * The class handles the conversion between different coordinate systems:
     * - Image coordinates (pixel-based, top-left origin)
     * - Texture coordinates (normalized 0-1 range, bottom-left origin)
     * - World coordinates (transformation matrix-based positioning)
     *
     * Common Use Cases:
     * - Sprite rendering for games and interactive applications
     * - UI element graphics and interface components
     * - Texture atlas rendering for efficient sprite animation
     * - Background and environment art rendering
     * - Font glyph rendering (through Font class integration)
     *
     * The texture integrates seamlessly with the engine's transformation system,
     * allowing for easy scaling, rotation, and positioning of graphics elements.

         * \brief Draw the entire texture with transformation and color tinting
         * \param display_matrix Transformation matrix for positioning, scaling, and rotation
         * \param color RGBA color value for tinting the texture (default: white/no tint)
         *
         * Renders the complete texture to the screen using the provided transformation
         * matrix to control positioning, scaling, and rotation. This is the primary
         * method for drawing sprites, UI elements, and other texture-based graphics.
         *
         * Transformation Handling:
         * The method automatically handles the necessary coordinate system conversions
         * and applies appropriate scaling and translation to ensure the texture appears
         * correctly positioned according to the transformation matrix. The texture is
         * drawn with its center as the transformation origin.
         *
         * Color Tinting:
         * The color parameter allows for real-time tinting of the texture without
         * modifying the original image data. This enables effects like:
         * - Color-based visual feedback (damage flashing, selection highlighting)
         * - Transparency and fade effects through alpha channel modification
         * - Uniform lighting or environmental color effects
         * - UI state visualization (disabled buttons, hover states)
         *
         * Rendering Integration:
         * The method integrates with the engine's 2D renderer for efficient batched
         * rendering, automatically managing texture binding and shader state for
         * optimal performance when drawing multiple textures.

         * \param color RGBA color value for tinting the texture (default: white/no tint)

         * Renders a specific rectangular region of the texture, enabling sprite sheet
         * functionality, texture atlases, and animation frame rendering. This method
         * is essential for efficient graphics where multiple sprites or animation
         * frames are packed into a single texture file.
         *
         * Sprite Sheet Applications:
         * - Character animation frames stored in a grid layout
         * - UI element collections (buttons, icons, decorative elements)
         * - Tile sets for 2D game environments
         * - Font glyph rendering from character atlases
         * - Particle effect textures with multiple variations
         *
         * Coordinate System:
         * The texel_position uses pixel coordinates with (0,0) at the top-left
         * of the texture, following standard image coordinate conventions. The
         * method automatically converts these to the appropriate OpenGL texture
         * coordinates for rendering.
         *
         * Performance Benefits:
         * Using sprite sheets reduces texture binding overhead and improves
         * rendering performance by allowing multiple related graphics to be
         * stored in a single texture object, enabling more efficient batching.
         *
         * The transformation matrix affects the final rendered size and position,
         * while frame_size determines which portion of the texture is sampled.
