 * \brief Runtime information about the window and application state
 *
 * WindowEnvironment provides access to essential runtime metrics and window
 * properties that are commonly needed by game logic, rendering systems, and
 * debugging tools. This information is updated each frame to reflect the
 * current state of the application.
 *
 * Timing Information:
 * - DeltaTime: Time elapsed since the last frame (for frame-rate independent movement)
 * - ElapsedTime: Total time since application started (for animations and effects)
 * - FrameCount: Total number of frames rendered (for debugging and profiling)
 * - FPS: Current frames per second (for performance monitoring)
 *
 * Display Information:
 * - DisplaySize: Current viewport dimensions in pixels (for coordinate calculations)
 *
 * Common use cases:
 * - Frame-rate independent animations and movement
 * - Performance monitoring and debugging
 * - UI scaling based on viewport size
 * - Time-based effects and animations

/**
 * \brief Central application engine managing all core systems and subsystems
 *
 * Engine serves as the main application framework that coordinates all major
 * subsystems including windowing, input handling, rendering, game state management,
 * and resource management. It implements the singleton pattern to provide global
 * access to these systems while maintaining proper initialization order and
 * cleanup procedures.
 *
 * Architecture and Design:
 * - Singleton pattern ensures single engine instance across the application
 * - Pimpl idiom hides implementation details and reduces compilation dependencies
 * - Static accessor methods provide convenient access to subsystems
 * - Manages complete application lifecycle from startup to shutdown
 *
 * Core Subsystems:
 * - Window: SDL-based window management and OpenGL context creation
 * - Input: Keyboard, mouse, and controller input handling
 * - Renderer2D: High-level 2D graphics rendering system
 * - GameStateManager: State machine for different application screens/modes
 * - TextureManager: Resource management for texture assets
 * - Logger: Debug and event logging system
 *
 * Application Lifecycle:
 * 1. Start(): Initialize all subsystems and create window
 * 2. Update(): Process one frame of the main loop (input, logic, rendering)
 * 3. HasGameEnded(): Check if application should terminate
 * 4. Stop(): Clean shutdown of all subsystems
 *
 * The engine handles the complex initialization order required by modern
 * graphics applications, including OpenGL context creation, ImGui setup,
 * and proper resource management throughout the application lifecycle.
