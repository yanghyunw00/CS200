     * \brief RAII wrapper for loading and managing image pixel data from files
     *
     * The Image class provides a safe, automatic way to load image files (PNG, JPG, etc.)
     * and access their pixel data for use in graphics applications. It handles all the
     * complexity of file loading, memory management, and data conversion.
     *
     * Key Features:
     * - Automatic file loading using stb_image library
     * - Always converts to consistent RGBA format (4 bytes per pixel)
     * - RAII memory management (automatic cleanup in destructor)
     * - Move-only semantics to prevent expensive copying
     * - Optional vertical flipping for different coordinate systems
     *
     * Common Use Cases:
     * - Loading textures for sprites, backgrounds, UI elements
     * - Reading image data for procedural generation or analysis
     * - Converting various image formats to a consistent RGBA format
     * - Preparing pixel data for upload to GPU textures
     *
     * Memory Layout:
     * - Pixels stored in row-major order (left-to-right, top-to-bottom)
     * - Each pixel is 4 bytes: Red, Green, Blue, Alpha (0-255 each)
     * - Total memory = width × height × 4 bytes
     *
     * Example Usage:
     * \code
     * // Load an image file
     * Image sprite_image("sprites/player.png");
     *
     * // Get image properties
     * auto size = sprite_image.GetSize();
     * int width = size.x, height = size.y;
     *
     * // Access pixel data
     * const RGBA* pixels = sprite_image.data();
     * RGBA top_left_pixel = pixels[0];
     *
     * // Move to another Image (efficient)
     * Image moved_image = std::move(sprite_image);
     * \endcode

         * Implementation notes:
         * - Use assets::locate_asset() to find the full file path
         * - Use stb_image library functions to load the image data
         * - Always load as 4-channel RGBA regardless of source format
         * - Set stbi_set_flip_vertically_on_load() before loading

         * - Store the loaded pixel data and image dimensions
